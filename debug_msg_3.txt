Content: Perfect! I'll summarize the clarified user requirements and prepare acceptance criteria for the app development. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:

### **Finalized User Requirements for Physical Activity Tracker App**:

1. **Activity Tracking Type**:
    - Manual input for activities (walking, running, cycling).
    - Future additions (not part of this version): GPS tracking, fitness device integration.

2. **Activity Data to Record**:
    - Distance (in miles/km).
    - Duration (in minutes).
    - Calories burned (optional input).
    - Average speed (should be automatically calculated).

3. **Data Display**:
    - Summaries of activity (distance, total time, etc.).
    - Historical logs sorted by date.
    - Filtering by timeframes (e.g., "Today," "Last Week," "Last Month").
    - Future versions (not in this phase): Data graphs.

4. **Data Storage**:
    - Local browser storage (LocalStorage/SessionStorage).
    - No user accounts or cloud synchronization for version 1.

5. **Goal-Setting Features**:
    - Enable users to define a weekly goal (e.g., "Run for 5 hours this week").
    - Track progress toward that weekly goal.

6. **Optional Future Enhancements**:
    - Social sharing.
    - Integration with fitness wearables.

### **Proposed Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Users must be able to manually input their physical activities (type, distance, duration, optional calories burned).  
2. Average speed must auto-calculate based on distance and duration.  
3. Activity logs must be saved and retrievable via LocalStorage/SessionStorage.  
4. Logs must display summary totals (distance, duration, etc.) and support filtering by date range.  
5. Users must be able to set a weekly activity goal and track progress toward it.  
6. Application must handle edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, empty data fields).
7. Application UI must be simple, clean, and user-friendly.

**To the Software Engineer**: Let’s discuss technical implementation next. Any specific challenges or features you’d like to discuss?
