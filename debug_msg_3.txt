Content: ### Step 1: Gathering Clarification (Business Analyst Follow-Up)

**Business Analyst:** Just a quick follow-up to ensure weâ€™re aligned:

1. If this app is catering to elderly users, do you want minimal features for simplicity, or should we explore additional conveniences like product descriptions, user reviews, and ratings?

2. Should we include an order tracking feature for transparency and reassurance?

3. Do you have a specific color scheme or branding you'd like us to use, or should the software development team propose suitable designs?

Looking forward to your input so we can move forward with a complete understanding!
