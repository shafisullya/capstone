Content: ### Business Analyst: Initial Inquiry and Requirements Clarification  

**BA:** Thanks for confirming the requirements. Before we proceed into detailed implementation discussions, let me align the team on the workflow.  
Do you have any additional preferences regarding:
1. **Design Style:** Do you have a preference for a modern, minimal design (flat colors) or something with more dynamic/animated elements?  
2. **Core Interactions:** Should key actions like submitting activity logs or updating goals have clear feedback (e.g., confirmation messages) for enhanced usability?

---  
**PO:** Based on your feedback, Iâ€™ll confirm user expectations and edge-case handling further before implementation.

**Team:** Let's enter into the Software Engineer stage of technical breakdown. All clears?
