1. **User Functionality**:
   - Users can browse a list of grocery items with details (name and price per unit).
   - Users can add items to a cart and set quantities for each item.
   - Users can easily remove items from the cart or adjust quantities directly.

2. **Checkout Process**:
   - The total price is automatically calculated and displayed during cart updates.

   - Informs the user if trying to checkout with an empty cart.

4. **Design and User Interface**:

   - Hover effects and visual cues for buttons to enhance usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
