Content: Thank you for the acceptance criteria and clarifications. Based on the provided details, hereâ€™s how I propose approaching the technical implementation:

### **Technical Approach**
**HTML**:
- Define a structured layout with sections for:
  1. Grocery categories and items.
  2. Shopping cart summary.
  3. Checkout form.
  4. Search bar at the top for item searching.
  
**CSS**:
- Responsive design.
- Priority on a clean and minimalistic layout with readable fonts and spacing.
- Styling for buttons and interactive elements like "Add to Cart."

**JavaScript**:
- **Cart Functionality**:
  - Add, remove, and dynamically update items in the cart.
  - Prevent checkout with an empty cart.
- **Search Feature**:
  - Filter and display matching items based on keyword input.
- **Checkout Validation**:
  - Ensure name and address are provided.
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - Update the total price and item count in the cart summary dynamically.

### Next Steps:
I will implement the following:
1. Core structure with HTML.
2. Styling with CSS for responsiveness and usability.
3. JavaScript for managing the features outlined above.

Before I proceed, confirm if you have any other additional requirements/corrections. If all is clear, I will provide the finalized code!
