   - Users can add items to a cart and adjust quantities for each item.
   - Users can remove items from the cart or empty the cart.

2. **Checkout Process:**

   - Alerts users if they attempt actions with empty carts.
   - A clear, user-friendly checkout process that resets the cart upon completion.

   - Validates inputs for actions such as adjusting quantities in the cart.

4. **Design and UI/UX:**
   - Intuitive, minimalistic design with responsive styling for mobile and desktop.
   - Clear button labels and hover states for enhanced user guidance.

### Out of Scope (To Consider for Future Versions):

1. **Backend Support:**
   - No database integration or persistent user accounts; cart data is reset upon reload.
   - User authentication and login functionality were deprioritized for simplicity in v1.

2. **Additional Features:**
   - No sorting/filtering of grocery list items (e.g., by category or price).
   - Payment integration or purchase confirmation stubs are placeholders for future implementation.

3. **Advanced UI/UX:**
   - Limited personalization or thematic branding; designed for functionality first.
