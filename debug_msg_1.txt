Content: ### Step 1: Business Analyst Gathering Requirements

**Business Analyst:** Thank you for your request. I understand you're looking for an app to order the best wet wipes that can substitute for bathing, specifically targeted for elderly users. To better understand and deliver your expectations, I have a few questions:

1. Should the app allow users to compare different wet wipe brands, or will it focus solely on selling a pre-approved "best option"?
2. Do you want the app to include features like subscription services (e.g., recurring orders) or just one-time purchases?
3. Since the app is designed for elderly users, do you have specific accessibility requirements, such as larger fonts, simple navigation, or voice assistance compatibility?

Your input will help us create a tailored solution!
