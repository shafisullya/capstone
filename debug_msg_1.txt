Content: ### Step 1: Business Analyst Analyzing Requirements

Hello! Thank you for requesting a grocery ordering web application! To ensure I understand your requirements thoroughly, I have a few clarifying questions:

1. **Core Features**: What core functionalities do you want included in the app? For example, should users be able to create an account, browse grocery items by category, add them to a cart, and checkout?
2. **Payment Options**: Do you want the system to support online payments (e.g., credit card, PayPal) or just in-store pickup with cash on delivery?
3. **Admin Features**: Will there be administrative functionality, such as managing product inventory, pricing, promotions, and order tracking?
4. **Additional Features**: Would you like to include search functionality, filters (e.g., price, brand, category), or order history for users?
5. **Design and Style**: Do you have a specific theme/style/design approach for the app? Modern, minimalistic, colorful?
6. **Target Audience**: Is this a web app for a specific grocery store, chain stores, or an open marketplace that will connect multiple stores?

Your input will help shape the initial project requirements. Letâ€™s discuss!

### Step 2: Product Owner Crafting Acceptance Criteria

To move forward, once we finalize the features and core functionality, I will work with the Product Owner to establish clear acceptance criteria for this project.

Shall we proceed with clarifying the details?
