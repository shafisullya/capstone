Content: ### Step 1: Gather User Requirements and Clarify Questions (Business Analyst)

Hello! Let's discuss the calculator app you want to build. Here are some clarifying questions to ensure we fully understand your requirements:

1. **Features**: What operations would you like the calculator to support? Basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) or advanced functions (e.g., square root, percentage, scientific calculations)?
2. **Design and Styling**: Do you have any design preferences or themes (e.g., minimalist, colorful, professional)?
3. **User Interaction**: Should the calculator be keyboard-friendly, or will it only function with button clicks?
4. **Edge Cases**: Are there specific scenarios we should handle, such as dividing by zero or very large numbers?

Let us know, and I'll create a detailed project outline!
