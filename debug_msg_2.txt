1. **Core Features**: The web app should allow users to browse groceries by categories, add items to a shopping cart, view the cart summary, and proceed to a simple checkout process (no login or account is needed, just name and address for now).
2. **Payment Options**: Online payment is **not required initially**, but users should be able to select "home delivery" or "pickup at store" as delivery options.
3. **Admin Features**: No admin panel or advanced inventory management features are required at this point; just a standalone app for placing orders.
4. **Additional Features**: Yes, we would like to have a simple keyword-based search bar so users can quickly locate items. Filters are not mandatory for the first version.
5. **Design and Style**: A clean, modern, and minimalistic design with a focus on usability and responsiveness.
6. **Target Audience**: This is for a single grocery store to allow its customers to place online orders conveniently.
