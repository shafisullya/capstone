Content: Thank you for asking clarifying questions! Here are the answers:

1. **Tracking Type:** The initial version should primarily allow manual input for activities. GPS-based tracking and device integration can be added later as future enhancements.  
2. **Activity Data:** Yes, specific activity data is crucial. Users should log distance (in miles/km), duration (in minutes), and optionally include calories burned. Calculating average speed based on the logged distance and duration would also be a nice-to-have.  
3. **Data Display:** Displaying data as summaries and historical logs is essential. Allow filtering by date (e.g., Today, Last Week, Last Month). Graphs can be considered as future enhancements but are not essential in version 1.  
4. **User Accounts:** No user accounts or synchronization are needed for this version. The app should primarily use browser storage (e.g., LocalStorage/SessionStorage).  
5. **Extra Features:** Goal-setting would be ideal, such as allowing users to set a weekly activity duration goal (e.g., "Run for 5 hours this week") and tracking their progress toward the goal. Social sharing is not required for the first version.

Let me know if you need further clarification!
